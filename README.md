## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I used this project to put in practice the concepts of display grid. Thanks to it, it was a much easier task to develop the whole layout of the web page and make it responsive with just needing to touch a fewer lines of code than other projects I made before.

Also another thing worth mention is, this is the first reponsive navbar that I do, will keep practicing more Javascript to create cool stuff like this.

### Continued development

Moving on from here I have interest in continuing developing more complex layouts by mixing up both display grid and flex.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - It's always useful having an official source of truth. This website helps to be up to date with new changes made for Javascript and CSS tools
- [W3Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - Having always a bit code to mess with and make sure of understanding a property comes very handy.
